# RNAseq Analysis Pipeline

## Overview

This repository contains two pipelines for the analysis of RNA sequencing data. The first pipeline focuses on data processing using Salmon and DESeq2, while the second pipeline retrieves RNA sequencing data from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), performs alignment with HISAT2, and conducts quality control and differential expression analysis with DESeq2, DREAM, and limma.
