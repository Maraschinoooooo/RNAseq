# RNAseq Analysis Pipeline

## Overview

This repository contains pipelines for the analysis of RNA sequencing data. The primary goal is to provide a workflow for processing RNAseq data from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), conducting alignment with HISAT2 and salmon, batch effect correction with Combat-seq, and performing quality control and differential expression analysis with DESeq2, DREAM, and limma.
